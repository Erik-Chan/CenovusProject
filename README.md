# Congestion Pricing


This was a project done during the Math to the Power Industry workshop. The project involved the study of crude oil prices on a spatial network to detect periods of anonmalous pricing behavior due congestion in the transportation network using a non-linear mixed integer program. We then estimate the congestion premium.
